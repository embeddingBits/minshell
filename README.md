# fastsh
Mini experimental shell in Zig from scratch

A rough implementation of a usable shell and then I'll move on to refractoring and structuring of the whole shell

## Things to be done
- [x] `ls` command
- [x] `echo` command
- [x] `exit` command
- [x] `pwd` command
- [x] `type` command
- [x] `cd` command
- [x] `dirs` command
- [x] `pushd` command
- [x] `popd` command
- [ ] `alias` command
